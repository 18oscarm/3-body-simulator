This script simulates the trajectories of N massive bodies travelling through space. The complex forces exhibited by each body in space cause chaotic trajectories.

Run Nbody.py and select the number of planetary objects you want to model. 
Currently, the model plots planetary objects all with mass 1, from random starting positions and from random initial velocities. All of this can be easily changed when needed.

This was inspired by https://github.com/Younes-Toumi/Younes-Toumi

Future improvements:
Improve efficiency
Use other methods that don't use system_odes
Animate the trajectories
