This script simulates the trajectories of N massive bodies travelling through space. Chaotic trajectories are exhibited due to the complex forces exhibited by each body in space.

Run Nbody.py and select the number of planetary objects you would like to model. 
Currently, the model plots planetary objects all with mass 1, from random starting positions and from random initial velocities. All of this can be easily changed when needed.
